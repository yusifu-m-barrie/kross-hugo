      I have the ability to plan, organize, manage, and complete projects or tasks effectively while meeting deadlines;
      I always manage my workloads, meeting deadlines, and producing quality work in a professional environment;
      I set goals and manage priorities to meet established objectives, outcomes, and timelines, and demonstrate an ability to organize and carry out multiple tasks or projects at the same time.
      I identify reliable sources of good information and data, determining the suitability of information for projects or research, and organizing information and data using appropriate technology and methodology.

    content: The ultimate goal of my systems/applications is to satisfy the stated
      objectives such as accuracy, stability, and input/output relationships. Nevertheless
      it is appropriate to separately evaluate the individual components of the system.
      Therefore, I will evaluate the quality of my end products. There are two categories
      of performance criteria with which I evaluate the “goodness”. Quantitative criteria
      include dynamic efficiency (speed of execution), static efficiency (memory requirements),
      and accuracy of the results. Qualitative criteria center on ease of software
      maintenance. Another qualitative way to evaluate my end product is ease of understanding.

    content: "Once done. I Show my clients the initial demo. \nTake some inputs from
      him. Debate on some inputs if I think are outrageous or are out of this world.\nOnce
      I have gathered more info. Go back to coding and this time I try to finish it
      upto 90%.\nI Show him 2nd demo. Try to get final details and tuneups that are
      needed.\nGo back to work and finish it.\nShow him the finished product. If he
      still wants changes. I informed him I will make this changes once the site is
      on his server. Because server environment also plays an important role. \nI
      Do my final touches here. Tell him its done.\nExpect some more changes and finish
      those too."
