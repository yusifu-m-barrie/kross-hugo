      The ultimate goal of my systems/applications is to satisfy the stated objectives such as accuracy, stability, and input/output relationships. Nevertheless it is appropriate to separately evaluate the individual components of the system. Therefore, I will evaluate the quality of my end products. There are two categories of performance criteria with which I evaluate the “goodness”. Quantitative criteria include dynamic efficiency (speed of execution), static efficiency (memory requirements), and accuracy of the results. Qualitative criteria center on ease of software maintenance. Another qualitative way to evaluate my end product is ease of understanding.

                  Easy to debug (fix mistakes)

                  Easy to verify (prove correctness)

                  Easy to maintain (add features)

    content: "Once done. I Show my clients the initial demo. \nTake some inputs from
      him. Debate on some inputs if I think are outrageous or are out of this world.\nOnce
      I have gathered more info. Go back to coding and this time I try to finish it
      upto 90%.\nI Show him 2nd demo. Try to get final details and tuneups that are
      needed.\nGo back to work and finish it.\nShow him the finished product. If he
      still wants changes. I informed him I will make this changes once the site is
      on his server. Because server environment also plays an important role. \nUpload
      files to his server and block access with .htaccess for outer world. OR just
      leave it open if its a small site that nobody cares about.\nI Do my final touches
      here. Tell him its done.\nExpect some more changes and finish those too.\nAsk
      for your payment now."
